# More Categories: A Plugin for Pelican

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pelican-plugins/more-categories/main.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/more-categories/actions)
[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pelican-more-categories)](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-more-categories/)
![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pelican-more-categories?color=blue)

This Pelican plugin adds support for multiple categories per article and nested
categories. It requires Pelican 4.2.0 or newer.

The `example` directory contains a minimal Pelican web site that can be used for testing.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-more-categories

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `more-categories` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

## Multiple Categories

To indicate that an article belongs to multiple categories, use a
comma-separated string:

    Category: foo, bar, bazz

This will add the article to the categories `foo`, `bar`, and `bazz`.

### Templates

Existing themes that use `article.category` will display only the first of
these categories, `foo`. This plugin adds `article.categories` that you can
loop over instead. To accommodate this plugin in a theme whether it is present
or not, use:

```jinja2
{% for cat in article.categories or [article.category] %}
    <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ cat.url }}">{{ cat }}</a>{{ ', ' if not loop.last }}
{% endfor %}
```

## Nested Categories

(This is a re-implementation of the `subcategory` plugin.)

To indicate that a category is a child of another category, use a
slash-separated string:

    Category: foo/bar/bazz

This will add the article to the categories `foo/bar/bazz`, `foo/bar` and
`foo`.

### Templates

Existing themes that use `article.category` will display the full path to the
most specific of these categories, `foo/bar/bazz`. For any category `cat`, this
plugin adds `cat.shortname`, which in this case is `bazz`, `cat.parent`, which
in this case is the category `foo/bar`, and `cat.ancestors`, which is a list of
the categoryâ€™s ancestors, ending with the category itself. For instance, to
also include a link to each of the ancestor categories on an article page, in
case this plugin in present, use:

```jinja2
{% for cat in article.category.ancestors or [article.category] %}
    <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ cat.url }}">{{ cat.shortname or cat }}</a>{{ '/' if not loop.last }}
{% endfor %}
```

Likewise, `category.shortname`, `category.parent`, and `category.ancestors` can
also be used on the category template.

Additionally, this plugin adds `category.children`: a `list` of categories
that have `category` as a parent.

```jinja2
{% for child in category.children %}
    <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{child.url}}">{{child.shortname|capitalize}}</a>
{% endfor %}
```

If you need all descendent children and not just the immediate children, you can use the `list` of descendent children: `category.descendents`

### Slug

The slug of a category is generated recursively by slugifying the short name of
the category and its ancestors (preserving slashes):

    slug-of-(foo/bar/baz) := slug-of-foo/slug-of-bar/slug-of-baz

### Category Folders

To specify categories using the directory structure, you can configure
`PATH_METADATA` to extract the article path into the `category` metadata. The
following settings would use the entire structure:

```python
    PATH_METADATA = "(?P<category>.*)/.*"
```

If you store all articles in a single `articles/` folder that you want to
ignore for this purpose, use:

```python
    PATH_METADATA = "articles/(?P<category>.*)/.*"
```

### Categories in Templates

The list `categories` of all pairs of categories with their corresponding
articles, which is available in the context and can be used in templates (e.g.
to make a menu of available categories), is ordered lexicographically, so
categories always follow their parent:

    aba
    aba/dat
    abaala
